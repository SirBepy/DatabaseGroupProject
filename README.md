# DatabaseGroupProject

## Prerequisites

  1. Java (atleast JDK 8.0)
  2. MySQL Database

## How to run

  In order to run this app, you have to use the dump.sql file. You need to run all of the content of the file. 
  After that you can start the Test.java file. You need to run it with a MySQL driver though.
  You also need to make sure you either change the following lines
        String username = "root";
        String password = "1234";
  to whatever your username and password are, or you can add a username called root with the password 1234.
